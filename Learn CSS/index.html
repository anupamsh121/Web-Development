        <h2 class="highlight">Ups and Down</h2>
        <p>
          Apple is one of the most successful and valuable companies in the
          world, but it hasn't always been that way. The company has had its
          fair share of ups and downs over the years, including a near-collapse
          in the mid-1990s and a remarkable resurgence in the late 1990s and
          early 2000s.

          <br /><br />Here's a brief overview of Apple's fall and rise:
          <br /><br />
          Fall:<br />
          In the early 1990s, Apple was struggling with declining sales and
          market share. Its products were seen as outdated and overpriced, and
          the company was losing ground to competitors like Microsoft and IBM.
          In 1993, Apple introduced the Newton, a personal digital assistant
          (PDA) that was a commercial failure and cost the company millions of
          dollars. In 1996, Apple brought back its co-founder Steve Jobs as an
          advisor, and he became CEO the following year. However, Jobs initially
          struggled to turn the company around and faced criticism for some of
          his early decisions, such as canceling the Newton and licensing the
          Macintosh operating system to other companies. <br /><br /><br />

          Rise: <br />
          In the late 1990s, Jobs refocused Apple on a few core products,
          including the iMac and the PowerBook. These products were praised for
          their design, ease of use, and innovative features, and helped to
          revive the company's fortunes. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, a
          portable music player that was a huge success and helped to establish
          the company as a leader in consumer electronics. The success of the
          iPod paved the way for other groundbreaking products, such as the
          iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010. These devices helped Apple to
          become the most valuable company in the world by 2011, with a market
          capitalization of over $600 billion. Today, Apple continues to be a
          major player in the technology industry, with a focus on innovation
          and design. While the company may face challenges in the future, its
          past success has shown that it has the ability to adapt and thrive in
          a rapidly changing market.
